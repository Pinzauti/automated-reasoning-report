   The aim of this project is to solve a \emph{Constraint Satisfaction Problem} using both \emph{Answer Set Programming} and \emph{MiniZinc}. On top of that a Python program was developed which allows the user to automatically choose to solve the problem with one of the two models. The user can also choose if the input should be generated randomly or inserted manually. In the first case he has control over some parameters of the problem (e.g. dimension of the grid).
