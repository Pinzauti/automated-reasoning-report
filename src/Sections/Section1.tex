\section{The problem}
The\graffito{If you need further details and an example, you can download the complete assignment explanation \textattachfile[appearance=False]{Images/Project.png}{here}.} task is to construct non-crossing and non-overlapping paths that start from given numbered grid cells and meet each other in a single cell. The paths can make horizontal and vertical transitions between neighboring cells but must not pass numbered grid cells (except for their origins). Most importantly, for each path, the number in its origin cell prescribes the number of turns, that is, alternation between horizontal and vertical transition or vice versa, the path has to make.
